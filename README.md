🚀 Galaxy Shooter (Unity Prototype)

Galaxy Shooter is a 2D arcade space shooter prototype built in Unity, focusing on gameplay systems, player interaction, and replayable game loops.
This project was created during my early Unity learning phase and uses legacy Unity patterns, but demonstrates solid understanding of core gameplay mechanics.

⚠️ Note: This is a prototype, not a production-ready project.

🎮 Gameplay Overview

Fast-paced endless space shooter

Player(s) survive waves of enemies while collecting powerups

Designed to be restartable and replayable

Supports local co-op (2 players on the same device)

✨ Key Features

🔫 Player shooting & movement system

👾 Enemy spawning with random patterns

💥 Enemy shooting mechanics

⚡ Powerups (temporary boosts & effects)

🤝 Local co-op mode (2 players)

🔁 Endless gameplay loop with restart support

🎞️ Animations & animation state transitions

🧠 Script-to-script communication between gameplay systems

🕹️ Controls (Example)

Player 1: Keyboard

Player 2: Secondary keys / same-device input

Shoot / Move: Mapped via legacy Unity Input system

🛠️ Tech Stack

Engine: Unity

Language: C#

Input: Legacy Unity Input system

Platform: PC

⚠️ Known Limitations (Intentional Transparency)

Uses legacy Input system (not Unity’s new Input System)

Beginner-era architecture (tightly coupled scripts)

No dependency injection / event-driven systems

Not optimized for scalability or long-term expansion

These limitations are intentional to preserve the project as a learning snapshot.

🧪 Project Type

Category: Playable Prototype
Purpose: Learning & gameplay system experimentation
Status: Feature-complete prototype (no active development)

🔮 Possible Improvements (Not Implemented)

Migrate to Unity’s new Input System

Refactor architecture using events & ScriptableObjects

Improve separation of gameplay systems

Add difficulty scaling & boss waves

📌 Why This Project Exists

This project represents my progression from basic Unity scripting toward system-driven gameplay development.
More advanced architectural work can be found in my newer projects.
